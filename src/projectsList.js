        description: `Creating an animation of a crucial step in the Fourier transformation to deepen my mathematical understanding of it.
        The main insight that drives the Fourier transformation is that any signal can be decomposed into a set of simple sinusoidal elements. 
        In this animation, we're starting with the sinusoidal elements (depicted as a series of circular orbits) and then tracing out the signal that they generate.`
