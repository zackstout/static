      Greek tragedy is like pop culture: both are ever-relevant living documents. The difference is that 'pop culture'
      is alive and relevant because it's indexed to time &mdash; we feel entitled to ask, "The 'pop' of <i>when</i>?".
      Greek tragedy, on the other hand, affects us with its depth of concern, its intensity of feeling, its sheer power
      to <i>endure</i> through time.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      Two of my favorite tragedies are Euripides' <i>Bacchae</i> and Sophocles' <i>Oedipus Rex</i>. Both focus on
      self-knowledge: the barriers to it, and the dangers and benefits that accompany its (gradual) attainment. Both
      (like many tragedies) deal with questions of fate, agency, and the desire to know oneself.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      <i>Oedipus</i> provides the clearer example. When he's born, Oedipus (<i>spoiler alert!</i>) is prophesized to
      marry his mother and kill his father. Upon hearing the prophecy, his father (Laius, king of Thebes) wants to
      eliminate Oedipus; but his mother, warm-hearted, entrusts the baby to a Theban shepherd.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      Oedipus grows up in another city. At one point he hears of the prophecy. Horrified at the idea of fulfilling it,
      he abandons the home of the people he takes to be his parents. Long story short, in his effort to avoid the
      prophecy, Oedipus ends up fulfilling it. On learning the truth, he blinds himself.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      The play takes the form of a detective story, in which Oedipus (current king of Thebes) searches for his father's
      murderer &mdash; which turns out to be himself. Many other characters &mdash; his mother/wife Jocasta, the
      shepherd who cared for him as a baby &mdash; try to dissuade Oedipus from discovering the truth, but he is
      relentless.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      Why should such a courageous pursuit of his own origin result in Oedipus's self-blinding? Why should his desire to
      see lead to his self-imposed darkness?
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      To answer this, we have to consider Sophocles' larger arc for Oedipus. In the sequel, <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>,
      Oedipus (aided by his daughter Antigone) achieves a kind of salvation. He gains the freedom to decide the fate of
      his traitorous sons; he attains an almost-divine status by the play's conclusion.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      Before he could arrive at this humbled state, Oedipus had to endure the pain of learning about his origins, his
      identity. But still, it's strange that Oedipus' submission to Fate &mdash; blinding himself in order to escape its
      power &mdash; turns out to be a necessary condition for exercising real agency. This is the puzzle that interests
      me.

    <div class="blogText">
      Turning to the <i>Bacchae</i> might provide an angle onto this question, of why fate and freedom are so
      inextricably bound together in Oedipus' case (and throughout Greek tragedy). This story also takes place in
      Thebes, many years earlier. Dionysus, or Bacchus, has returned to the city after recruiting a fleet of women (from
      the East) to exact revenge for his mother's exile. She was exiled for claiming her child was a god (a child of
      Zeus); so naturally, Dionysus' goal is to prove his divine power.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      Enter King Pentheus, whose combination of inexperience and arrogance perfectly encapsulates youth. He stands for
      order, adherence to social norms, imprisonment, consistency. The central clash of the play is between Pentheus and
      Dionysus, who is impersonating a priest (of Dionysus).
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      Dionysus is cited as god of many things: wine, revelry, revelation, masks, forgetting, oblivion. One way of
      understanding Dionysus' <i>divinity</i> is that we cannot understand human nature without accounting for
      <i>Dionysian</i> forces, influences, traits. Pentheus initially rejects these elements of humanity, but ultimately
      proves to be voyeuristically curious.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      At one point, after warning Pentheus not to bind him, Dionysus analyzes Pentheus: "You do not know why you live,
      or what you are doing, or who you are" (505). This is pretty much borne out: Pentheus is destroyed by his
      unwillingness to accept or acknowledge certain psychic forces. Seen in a certain light, it is Pentheus' ignorance
      of himself, of what makes him a human, that catalyzes his demise.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      This prompts a preliminary answer to our question about Oedipus. He must paradoxically acknowledge his fate before
      he's freed, must see himself as he is before moving forward authentically in the world.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      This seems paradoxical because we find it natural (or at least I do) to think of a self as a function from
      situation to behavior. If your self is fixed, then given a certain input situation you'll return the expected
      output behavior. If someone knew all the facts about you and your situation, they could deduce what action you
      would take. And yet, it's Pentheus' unwillingness to acknowledge certain things about his nature that results in
      his destruction, and it's Oedipus' acknowledgement of those things that allows for his freedom and ultimate
      salvation.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      I guess the takeaway here is that it's a mistake to think that reflecting on our personal history and nature will
      only serve to restrict our action. Rather than imposing constraints on our behavior, it turns out that reflecting
      on, engaging with and ultimately accepting certain facts about ourselves will enlarge and enrich our freedom to
      engage with the world.

    <div class="blogText">
      It feels appropriate to conclude with a Spinoza quote: "The more clearly you understand yourself and your
      emotions, the more you become a lover of what is."
