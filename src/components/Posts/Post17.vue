    <div class="blogText">
      The distinction we sometimes naturally draw between behavior and identity &mdash; what one does and who one is
      &mdash; has always struck me as at best porous, and at worst fraught.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      Of course the distinction can be useful. For example, say John is accused of a sexist action. It's easier to
      accept this, psychologically, than to try to defend oneself against the charge of being a sexist.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      But I'm more interested in the ways in which this distinction can become dangerous, and perhaps be dissolved. It's
      easy to fall into thinking of an identity &mdash; a conception of onself (as e.g. artist, programmer, friend), or
      an affiliation with a group (family, nation, religion) &mdash; as a program for generating appropriate behavior.
      "I am a violinist, so I should play the violin; indeed, I must play in order to maintain my identity."
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      In the film <i>Brink</i>, the main character is counseled by his father: "Skating isn't who you are; skating is
      what you do." This is all well and good, and it likely planted the seeds for my thoughts early in life. But for
      the majority of my life, being a student wasn't something I did: it was who I was.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      So I can attest to the ways in which an identity, a certain self-conception, can become like a carapace. Like an
      insect's exoskeletal shell, an identity ("I am a student") can provide structure and guidance to one's behavior.
      It can also provide protection against possible assailants of one's motivation.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      But it can also become brittle, inhibiting one's growth and generating unhealthy expectations. Focusing on only
      one aspect of your identity can delude you; suddenly your worth seems to depend on that aspect alone. Suddenly
      only behaviors associated with that conception of yourself come naturally to you. Suddenly you are not sure who
      you are beyond being someone who plays that role.
    </div>

    <div class="blogText">
      I grant this may seem melodramatic. Still, I think the core idea stands. Be yourself, and even be "yourself"
      &mdash; you as you conceive yourself to be &mdash; but don't be a prisoner to "yourself." Be yourself.
